### Matrix:
All the files below uses Matrix / Array[arrays]. Please, keep in mind that this matrices follow this definition:

    let arr; // Some particular matrix. Therefore:
    // X Row = arr.length
    // Y Rol = arr[0].length

    //if we print a particular matrix:

    [[1, 5, 0, 4], [0, 1, 0, 0],[0, 5, 1, 2],[0, 0, 0, 9]]

    Which represented looks like:

    [[1, 5, 0, 4]
    [0, 1, 0, 0]
    [0, 5, 1, 2]
    [0, 0, 0, 9]]

    This way, in order to select the (x, y) element we use the sintax 'arr[x][y]'.
    In this case, arr[0][0] = 1 and arr[3][3] = 9.
